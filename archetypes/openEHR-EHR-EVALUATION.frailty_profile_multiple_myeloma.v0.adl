					description = <"The International Myeloma Working group (IMWG) proposed a frailty score in 2015, to predict mortality and risk of toxicity in elderly multiple myeloma patients. It relies on patient age and the resulting scores from three validated assessment tools: the Katz Activities of Daily Living scale (ADL), the Lawton Instrumental Activies of Daily Living (IADL) scale and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The frailty score was built combining age, ADL, IADL and CCI, evaluating their prognostic role on overall-survival. The frailty score ranges from 0-5 points, and is used to define the frailty profile in elderly patients, which corresponds to 3 risk groups: fit, intermediate fitness or frail. The 3-year overall survival was 84% in fit, 76% in intermediate-fitness and 57% in frail.">
